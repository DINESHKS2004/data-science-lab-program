# Lists of item prices and quantities
item_prices = [100, 50, 20]        # e.g., 3 items
item_quantities = [2, 3, 5]        # quantities for each item

# Given rates
discount_rate = 10  # in percent
tax_rate = 5        # in percent

# Step 1: Calculate subtotal
subtotal = sum(p * q for p, q in zip(item_prices, item_quantities))

# Step 2: Apply discount
discount = subtotal * (discount_rate / 100)

# Step 3: Apply tax on discounted amount
tax = (subtotal - discount) * (tax_rate / 100)

# Step 4: Final total cost
total_cost = subtotal - discount + tax

# Display result
print("Subtotal:", subtotal)
print("Discount:", discount)
print("Tax:", tax)
print("Total cost to customer:", total_cost)
