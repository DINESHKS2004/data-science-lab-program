# Sample fuel efficiency data in miles per gallon (mpg) for car models
fuel_efficiency = np.array([22, 25, 30, 28, 35])  # Each value = a car's fuel efficiency

# Step 1: Calculate average fuel efficiency
average_efficiency = np.mean(fuel_efficiency)

# Step 2: Select two car models to compare (e.g., model A at index 1 and model B at index 4)
model_A = fuel_efficiency[1]  # 25 mpg
model_B = fuel_efficiency[4]  # 35 mpg

# Step 3: Calculate percentage improvement from model A to model B
percentage_improvement = ((model_B - model_A) / model_A) * 100

# Display results
print("Average fuel efficiency:", average_efficiency, "mpg")
print("Percentage improvement from model A to model B:", percentage_improvement, "%")
